 I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [COAI](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) group at Tsinghua University. 
 
 Prior to this, I received my PhD degree from the [School of Computer Science, Wuhan University](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), supervised by Professor [Tieyun Qian](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2852.htm).  

 I received my B.S. and M.Eng degrees from the [Department of EST, HUST](http://oei.hust.edu.cn/), supervised by Professor [Guoyi Yu](http://oei.hust.edu.cn/info/1104/5778.htm). 
 
 My current research interests include information extraction, emotional dialog systems, social intelligence of LLMs, etc.
